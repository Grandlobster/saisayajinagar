            On <strong>15th June 2024</strong>, <strong>Merit Housing Redevelopment Consultants</strong> presented a detailed <strong>feasibility report</strong> to our society members as part of the redevelopment process. This report helps residents understand how the project will proceed, what area they'll receive in the redeveloped structure, and how financially viable the project is for both society and developers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The session also included an open <strong>Q&A session</strong>, where all residents' doubts and questions were addressed by the PMC and technical team. This transparent discussion builds confidence and brings clarity to one of the most crucial stages of redevelopment.

          <h2 style="margin-top: 30px; color: rgb(160, 0, 64); font-size: 1.6rem;">Common Redevelopment Terms Explained</h2>

          <p>
            Understanding basic redevelopment terminology can help every resident make better decisions. Here are a few essential terms explained simply:
          </p>

          <p><strong>1. Carpet Area:</strong> This is the actual usable area within the walls of your flat — the space where you can lay a carpet. It excludes walls, balconies, and common areas.</p>

          <p><strong>2. RERA Carpet Area:</strong> Defined under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, RERA carpet area includes usable internal walls but still excludes balconies and common areas. Builders must now sell flats based on RERA carpet area only.</p>

          <p><strong>3. Built-up Area:</strong> This includes the carpet area + walls + internal ducts. Usually 10–15% more than the carpet area.</p>

          <p><strong>4. Super Built-up Area:</strong> Includes your built-up area plus your share of common amenities like staircase, lobby, lifts, etc. This is generally what developers used to sell on before RERA.</p>

          <p><strong>5. FSI (Floor Space Index):</strong> This is the ratio of total floor area built to the size of the plot. For example, if your plot is 10,000 sq ft and FSI is 2.0, then a builder can construct up to 20,000 sq ft.</p>

          <p><strong>6. TDR (Transfer of Development Rights):</strong> A mechanism where additional FSI can be purchased/transferred from another location to increase buildable space on your plot.</p>

          <p><strong>7. Corpus Fund:</strong> A lump-sum amount provided by the developer to the society to generate income and cover future expenses like maintenance, taxes, etc.</p>

          <p><strong>8. Rent Compensation:</strong> Temporary accommodation or monthly rent offered by the developer to existing residents while redevelopment is in progress.</p>

          <p>
            Understanding these terms ensures transparency and enables society members to ask informed questions and hold developers accountable during every phase of the project.
          </p>
